## Logline
EcoSnake is a sustainability-driven 3D game where player choices directly affect health, movement, and survival, demonstrating how environmental damage compounds over time through simple but meaningful mechanics. Players control a continuously moving snake that grows stronger by consuming apples, while consuming trash slows movement, shrinks the body, reduces vision, darkens the environment, and ultimately leads to death (game over).



## Tropes
Negative actions in the game do not result in immediate failure; instead, their effects accumulate gradually over time.
Consuming trash progressively slows the player’s movement, reduces visual clarity, darkens the environment, and ultimately leads to collapse.
Continuous forward motion is a foundational mechanic, requiring players to prioritize steering, timing, and spatial awareness.
Growth through item consumption introduces both progression and constraint.
Difficulty escalates naturally as increased body length limits maneuverability.
Single-character control emphasizes player skill and decision-making.

## Actions:
D → snake curves right
A → snake curves left
